### The results of Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation of the 2D Ising Model

The Hamiltonian of the Ising Model is
$$
H=-J\sum_{i,j}s_is_j-h\sum_{k}s_k
$$
The mean magnetization is
$$
\lang M\rang=\frac{1}{N}\left\langle\sum_{i}^Ns_i\right\rangle
$$
Adopting the mean field approximation, the mean energy is
$$
\lang E\rang=-J\sum_{i}^N\sum_{\lang i,j\rang}s_is_j
$$
The magnetic susceptibility is
$$
\chi=\frac{\lang M^2\rang-\lang M \rang^2}{Nk_BT}
$$
The specific heat is
$$
C_v=\frac{\lang E^2\rang-\lang E \rang^2}{Nk_BT^2}
$$
The spin configurations at different temperatures are shown below:



The temperature dependence of the thermodynamic quantities is shown below:



The behavior of critical exponent is shown below:
